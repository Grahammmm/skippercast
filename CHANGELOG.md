# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Fixed: every Cloudflare deploy since the gated workflow was rolled back by a false smoke-test failure (curl | grep -q under pipefail).
- Performance and abuse protection: the model API, forecast/intelligence/habitat endpoints and R2 feeds are edge-cached (`X-SC-Cache`), and `/api/om` (60/min) and `/feeds/` (300/min) are rate-limited per IP on Cloudflare.
- Security: every Worker response now carries HSTS, an enumerated Content-Security-Policy (moved from the page meta tag), frame-ancestors 'none', Permissions-Policy and COOP; vendored scripts and styles are pinned with SRI.
- Operations: data retention now runs on the Cloudflare cron as well as the trip-check job; `request_limits.expires_at` is indexed (migration 0001).
- AI boat lookup: a global daily cap (`BOAT_LOOKUP_GLOBAL_DAILY_LIMIT`, default 500), a `BOAT_LOOKUP_ENABLED` kill switch, and one usage log line per lookup with billed tokens and searches.
- Worker hardening: request errors are typed (only validation failures return their message), `/api/events/ack` validates the event id, and public `/api/health` no longer discloses which bindings and secrets exist.
- Development: shared `skippercast.util` time and file-hash helpers replace duplicated copies; CI runs `ruff check src` for syntax errors and undefined names.
- Development: `pip install -e ".[survey]"` (and `ocean`, `sst`, `publish`, `test`, `seafloor`, `dev`) installs pinned optional tools; `SKIPPERCAST_ROOT` points installed code at a checkout.
- Operations: R2 upload failures now fail the live and daily jobs, each `latest.json` records `published_at` and `run_id`, publishes are verified on the public `/feeds/` route, and the freshness monitor checks that route first.
- Operations: one region's refresh error no longer blocks the others; it is recorded as `status: failed` in the regional index, and the job fails only for the default region or a majority.
- Contracts: JSON Schemas in `schemas/` for regions, catalogs, jurisdictions, the daily, live and intelligence feeds, region indexes, coverage and forecast tiles, with `python -m skippercast validate` and CI validation of every committed file.
- Operations: structured JSON logging (`skippercast.log`), run manifests (`skippercast.runs`) and `python -m skippercast.report` step summaries; the forecast tile builder logs structured records and can write a run manifest.
- Conditions: surface currents and drift guides now use NOAA WCOFS samples from the regional pipeline (about 4 km, first 72 hours) instead of the browser's Open-Meteo request; the hourly sea-temperature weather layer is removed until an own source exists, and the legacy monitor requests SkipperCast's /api/om.
- Forecast range & uncertainty: the 31-member GEFS wind ensemble is now read directly from NOAA's GEFS open data on AWS once per cycle instead of Open-Meteo's non-commercial ensemble API.
- Web app: installable icons (PNG, maskable, Apple touch), faster startup via module preloading, a friendly retry card when the app fails to start, one combined notice when several optional layers fail, and neutral boat wording instead of the owner's boat name.

- Internal: removed duplicate and unused client files (including the unused 2.3 MB og.png), renamed -vN modules to canonical names, and made check_web.py reject -vN names in dist/.

- Security: the Cloudflare Worker no longer trusts ChatGPT identity headers; private features there return 401 until SkipperCast has its own sign-in.
- Fixed: trip-alert push notifications could never be enabled because the build renamed the service worker away from `/sw.js`.
- Seafloor runner setup now installs the schema validator and checks the manifest before processing or publishing.

- Tuna search overlays use the regional offshore footprint, reject uniform water and stale frames, support uncertainty-screened satellite fronts, and explain species-aware 1–3 search priorities separately from boat comfort.
- Seafloor publication: regional PMTiles, private survey recovery and a scheduled main-only workflow with checksum, restriction-expiry and public HTTP Range checks. The first Morro Bay archive contains 1,006 screened candidates; live acceptance follows a successful post-merge dispatch.

- Seafloor spatial screening: current CDFW, NOAA federal-area and reviewed security boundaries now qualify whole habitat polygons for tier 2. Missing, stale, changed or overlapping evidence stays held; publication follows separately.

- Seafloor habitat: reusable original-substrate joins, rough-bottom extraction, A/B/C terrain grades and source-cited 1–3 species planning fits. Three Morro Bay reaches now have private review outputs, including a real survey seam; legal screening still gates publication and export.

- Seafloor coverage: original-survey footprints now qualify planning cells and produce mask-aware terrain summaries for the first Morro Bay reaches. The ledger separates classified-cell area from actual selected survey area; habitat publication remains pending.

- Seafloor ingestion: reusable USGS GeoTIFF and regular NOAA BAG adapters, hash-verified private caching and native-resolution drafts. Two survey windows are qualified for processing; habitat coverage totals remain unchanged.

- Seafloor pipeline: reproducible Central Coast reach/grid baseline and a coverage-ledger CLI. All new tiers remain unprocessed until original surveys are ingested; the reference band is explicitly provisional. See [seafloor pipeline](docs/seafloor.md).
- Map engine test pages (`/map-test.html`, `/map-test-leaflet.html`) compare MapLibre with PMTiles vector tiles against today's Leaflet map on one layer. See [map engine test](docs/map-engine-test.md).
- Published feeds (live conditions, daily data, forecast tiles) now load through the site's `/feeds/` route, ready to be served from Cloudflare R2; the site can deploy to its own Cloudflare account. See [Cloudflare](docs/cloudflare.md).
- Boat profile: enter your boat (optionally looked up with AI and confirmed) and comfort and drift-control ratings scale to its length, weight, hull and layout. See [boat profile](docs/boat-profile.md).
- Search plans for five Central Coast preview regions now include their surveyed habitat footprints (575 in total); they had been built before those inputs existed.
- The live conditions feed is monitored hourly and reports when it stops refreshing.
- Hosting: SkipperCast runs only on its own Cloudflare Worker; ChatGPT Sites packaging, its origin and its identity headers are gone, `CUSTOM_DOMAINS` attaches skippercast.com and www.skippercast.com as custom domains (www redirects to the apex), and workers.dev stays on as staging.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-09-20

- Mobile-first map with Map, Spots, Forecast, and Guide navigation; no long page scroll to reach the map or weather.
- Compact spot cards expand into accessible detail sheets with persistent map and GPX actions; wide screens retain a docked list and detail panel.
- Collapsible filters, a reset action, 44-pixel map-marker hit areas, safe-area spacing, and readable mobile forecast comparisons.
- Direct single-spot GPX downloads for mobile and embedded browsers, with reproducible generation and checks for all 132 files.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-09-20

- Visible A/B/C terrain-grade definitions and practical context for points, reef outlines, and drift alignments.
- Per-target explanations of all four grading factors, weighted points, and capped contributions.
- Dated AIS evidence summary with eight sampled archive dates, source URLs, counts, hashes, and explicit lack of verified local sportfishing-charter tracks.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-20

- Public browser map with target search, habitat grades, depth filters, reef outlines, and optional drift alignments.
- Notes and GPX export for each selected target, plus the complete reviewed atlas downloads.
- On-demand ECMWF and NOAA wind/wave comparisons at three offshore samples, with missing-data, disagreement, coverage, and freshness notices.
- Model metadata, NWS advisory lookup, source attribution, and links to current rules and entrance information.
- Browser forecast and GPX tests, asset consistency checks, and vendored Leaflet with its license.

The app displays evidence for review; automated trip qualification and alert delivery remain separate integrations.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-20

Initial public research release:

- Portable forecast collector and alert lifecycle logic, with explicit operator-review boundaries.
- Public USGS-derived atlas: 132 habitat candidates, 107 outlines, 31 optional drift alignments.
- Reproducible GPX, GeoJSON, and offline notes from the included public data.
- Personal-use source license and separate third-party source notices.
- Offline tests, CI, contributor guide, and onboarding documentation.

The existing personal forecast deployment and full private research atlas are not migrated or replaced by this release. This initial research release did not include a hosted application.
